# Atlas-Engine
Merging of the V1 and V2 engines and reworking.

Borrowed much functionality from V1 however since it is pretty awfully written, nearly everything requires a rewrite.
Rather than dealing with badly written code and trying to adapt it, a rewrite can be found [here](https://github.com/YanniSperon/Andromeda)
